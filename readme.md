# Unit 5, Part 2 - HTML/CSS Practice

This assignment, we'll be reviewing HTML and CSS by styling a page which could be used for a record collection.

## Topics Covered 

- HTML review
- `background-color`
- `background-image`
- `margin`
- `padding`

## Assignment - Practice with HTML & CSS

Time to make our index.html page look cool!

Add all CSS through a Stylesheet. Do not use inline styles.

Update the HTML:

- Place the existing `h1` inside a `header` element. 
- Add an `h2` element into the `header` that says `YOUR NAME's Record Shop`.
- Place the existing `p` inside a `main` element.

Add a Stylesheet:

- Create a `stylesheet.css` file and source it into the HTML file.
- Give the `header` a dark background color and choose a light  color for the text.
- Center the text in the `header`.
- Give the `main` a light grey background color.
- Look up the CSS `background-image` property to learn how to use the provided `record.png` as the background image on your page with a relative path.
- Look up CSS `background-repeat` to learn how to fill the body of the page with a repeating image.
- Look up CSS `margin` and `padding`. 
  - Give the `body` a margin of `0`. (This removes the whitespace around the edges of the page.) 
  - Give the `main` padding of `1em`. (Curious about `em`? Look up CSS units.)

Here's an example of what the style could look like:
<img src="./example.png">

__STRETCH GOAL:__ Use CSS style classes vs element names to do your styling, except for adding the margin to the `body`. That is a good thing to add to every CSS file, and it should use the `body` HTML tag name.
